# Showkeybindings

Showkeybindings is a Python script that displays a Gtk window showing all
keybindings (aka keyboard shortcuts) specified in the Gnome gsettings
configuration. The bindings can be sorted by any column and are searchable.

## Dependencies

1. Python 3
2. Python Gtk+ 3

This has been tested only with Ubuntu and Cinnamon, although it should work
with any distro and window manager that support Gtk and gsettings.
